# lexical-analysis
For this assignment, I implemented a lexical analysis program for a limited version (i.e., the depth of the nested loops) of a programming language. Lexical analysis is the stage in which compilers parse and detect possible syntax errors. Ideally, any new (programming) languages can be designed and analyzed in the similar manner. A Pascal-and-C like language was analyzed in this assignment.
